# TrumpTwitterAnalysis
As an NLP practice, here machine learning (word2vec, LSI, LDA, NB, etc) technologies are employed to analyze Donald Trump's tweets. Program is based on Python. 

Twitter forbids researchers to share the data (especially the tweet text) directly with others. Therefore, people with interest need to download again using getData.py. The credentials need to be replaced.

Python Package requirement: numpy, pandas, sklearn, genSim, NLTK, pyLDAvis, tweepy, etc.

Run getData.py to download tweet data (Need to replace the keys and tokens by your own).
Run analyze.py to get the analysis results.
Run analyze.ipynb on notebook to get some fast results.
